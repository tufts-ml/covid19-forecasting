Dear new RA at Tufts,

Welcome to the project! We're excited to have you onboard.

Here's some reading you can do to get started

1) Read the "workplans" outlining the goals of this project

These documents summarize the high-level goals and deliverables for this project.

They are available through the shared "Box.com" folder you've been given access to

- Workplan_v202107.docx : What we proposed as of July 2021 for "round 2" of this project

2) Read about our published "hospital model" in this paper, which appeared at MLHC 2021
